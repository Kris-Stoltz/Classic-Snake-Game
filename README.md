This is my recreated version of the classic snake game using Python and Turtle graphics.
The game is not perfect, I'm struggling a bit with pixel perfect collision detection on the edge of the screen.
I believe this might be due to the fact that I am using a time.sleep method call in order to slow the animation down. 

This was just a fun little project I made in my journey of learning Python.
